**Notes**

```

Whenever we want to do anything that is realtime we use sockets and not http which are much more faster that
HTTP.

Hooks enable us do what otherwise would not have been possible in function based componets.This includes that functional
components may now have state as well as LifeCycle Methods.

There is a difference between Link and React Router.Router is more of how you create routes themselves and Link is more like a url that leads to the route.

JSX helps you write javascript in between your HTML.

```

**JSX**

```
JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.

Passsing data as query strings is where you decide to pass the data via a url as opposed to passing it via props or redux.
